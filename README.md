## Important Note
Due to my barely passable drawing skills alot of the sprites for the re-creation were taken from the original game "The Binding of Issac: Rebirth". I used an online website that posted these extracted sprites, hence all creditation goes to those wonderful individuals 
who took the time to extract the various arts pieces of the game. https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/bindingofisaacrebirth/

My desire was to evolve my understanding of game development and coding using C# by building from scratch the popular dungeon crawler game "The Binding of Issac"

<!-- HISTORY -->
## History

To begin, lets briefly describe the game and the history of its creation. Binding of Issac is a roguelike (a style of game that traditionally involves a player going through procedurally generated levels and usually has permanent death of the player) video game. It is a top-down shooter that has the player going through various rooms within a level, defeating enemies and obtaining items and proceeding to the next level upon eliminating the boss of the level. 

The game originally created by Edmund McMillen (designer and story-creation) & Florian Himsl (programmer) was the results of a week-long game jam. Edmund is actually known for another title he designed called “Super Meat Boy”. The goal of the game was intended to dive into “touchy” subjects in regards to religion, hence McMillen had expected the game to fail. 

McMillien wanted to incorporate the procedural generation inspired by “The Legend of Zelda” game’s dungeon structure.

<!-- ABOUT MY IMPLEMENTATION -->
## About My Implementation

As this was my first take on a "large" project past a few week-long games and a couple game-jams, I intended to make use of clean coding architecture and proper organization to mimic similar workflows as I imagine would be found in the industry. Furthermore, as this was a remake I ensured to follow many of the key features of the game, this made for easier planning but many obstacles. 

### Scenes

Firstly, lets talk about the scenes found in the game. In my case, I used two scenes, the title screen and the main gameplay loop. The title screen allows the player to start a new game, edit a few options and quit the application. The main gameplay loop is where the player is allowed to play the game with the option of pausing using the “ESC” key to select between: Resuming the game, returning to the main menu or quitting the application.

### Key Features

Moving on to a few key features. To begin, I knew I needed to incorporate the procedural dungeon generation. I had explored various options and within the scripts you can find 3 iterations of algorithms I tried to generate the dungeons. I first attempted to use a backtracking algorithm called “Depth First Search”, this algorithm uses a grid to explore a path by choosing random “neighbors” at each point,

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/f7036aa5-41b6-47ea-9b33-c5ccec5d981e)

It continues to explore until it hits a point where all its neighbors have already been visited or cannot be visited (i.e a wall),

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/a3803a37-b7ed-4f7a-a00c-1e2dd069736e)

 and then starts to “backtrack” along its created path until it find a point that has un-visited neighbors. 

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/2d2f2b01-e4e2-49e3-b086-30d60e898991)

This continues until the algorithm eventually backtracks to its starting position. This did indeed create a maze like dungeon, however it did not capture the essence of how the binding of issac’s rooms are laid out. Instead of a singular path with a few dead ends, BOI (Binding of Issac) tends to have various branches that lead to dead ends in various directions. Hence, I thought to try and use a Breath First Search-esk approach. Breath First search ultimately explores outward instead of following one path until a dead end. Thus, I took this same concept and tried to apply it to the dungeon generation. Essentially, I had the algorithm begin in the center of the grid and explore a finite amount of steps in one direction until backtracking a finite amount of steps and exploring a different direction. Once again, this still did not feel correct as per the original game, so lost in though and scrolling through the internet I stumbled upon Florian’s personal explanation of the games logic https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm_aCwRGMyAdCkytm9sp2-X7jfEU9ccXm and Boristhebrave https://www.boristhebrave.com/2020/09/12/dungeon-generation-in-binding-of-isaac/ . Boris goes in depth talking about the method Florian used to implement the procedural generation of the dungeon. 

As a brief summary, the game is generated on a 9x8 grid, I adjusted to make it 10x10. The number of rooms is determined by the following formula:

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/0c6c55b0-4052-4c91-bbde-9a1f118c6749)

Assuming the 9x8 grid is labeled 0 -> 79, the starting room is always cell 35. The alogrithm creates a queue inputting cell 35 and then continously popping the left most element and looping over the 4 possible directions and it does the following:

•	Determine the neighbour cell by adding +10/-10/+1/-1 to the currency cell.

•	If the neighbour cell is already occupied, give up

•	If the neighbour cell itself has more than one filled neighbour, give up.

•	If we already have enough rooms, give up

•	Random 50% chance, give up

•	Otherwise, mark the neighbour cell as having a room in it, and add it to the queue.

If a cell does not add to its neighbours, it is added to a list of “dead ends” which are later used for special rooms, such as the boss room, treasure room, item shop etc...

For example, this is one of the outputs of the algorithm:

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/8c2bdb37-ddd1-4a29-833b-37ee0380dd65)

So as we can see this is very similar to a breadth first search approach, but different than my own original implementation.

In my case, as mentioned earlier I used a 10x10 grid and started our player at cell 45. I only incorporated the Boss and treasure room simply due to the fact that creating more layouts of rooms was not my goal in this project. I was more interested in learning to develop a game from scratch and the inner working of how this game was created.



### Camera Movement

The camera itself does not maintain the player in the center of its FOV at all times. Rather in the game it moves between rooms whenever the player enters that specific room. Thus, thinking about how to implement this logic, I considered two options:

1.	Create a BoxCollider2D on each door to initiate the movement of the camera
   
2.	Move the camera by constantly tracking the players position.
   
As you may have guessed option 1 is less memory intensive and overall an easier implementation. So obviously… I chose option 2. Why? I really don’t know. But regardless, I decided to normalize the players position to the respective cell number of each room and then whenever the player’s normalized position changed, so did the camera. I don’t think this is the best strategy as it requires me to continously observe the players position and compute a small calculation to determine which cell they are in, but it was an interesting approach rather than simply using an onTriggerEnter2D event.

### Animation

Sigh… I really did not understand how tedious animation can be, and how time consuming. I limited my scope of creating characters and bosses due to how long the animations could take and then to tie them to the necessary logic of the player of enemy. I explored different options to create the animations. For example, the use of StateMachineBehavior classes in conjunction with the Animator. Such an implementation was used for my boss character since there were key states and state transitions that needed to happen in order to bring to life the boss. I could have simply used an Enum class to describe each of the states, but instead I found this method to work quite well for the case of my “boss battle”. For example, here is the simple Animator tree for my boss:

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/187d05f6-c329-4dbd-8d78-e56154be712c)

In the case of enemies, I instead created a base Enemy Controller class and created a public Enum class in order to handle state transitions, and for animation transitions I also used the animator tree however I did not create separate classes for each state.

### Enemy AI

In the original game, I believe there is no “wandering” mechanic for the enemies. Though curious, I wanted to try out different states that our enemies could take on. Hence In my EnemyController class, the main states of a Melee Enemy were: Idle, Wander, Follow, Attack and Die

-	The Idle state is used when the player is not in the same rooms as the enemy, preventing them from moving
  
-	The Wander state is activated if a player is out of the enemies “viewing” range and thus the enemy chooses random directions to walk in
  
-	The Follow state actives once the player is within the enemies “viewing” range and they track the player
  
-	The Attack state is activated once the player is within attacking range of the enemy and this causes the enemy to deal damage to the player
  
-	The Die state is activated once the player deals enough damage to the enemy and defeats them, causing their game Object to be destroyed.

### Enemy Spawning

In the original game, there were many different types of room layouts specifically designed by McMillen to his liking. Being limited on time I instead opted for random enemy and object spawning. To do this I created a grid for each room type that I had (Normal Room, Treasure Room and Boss Room) and then using scriptable objects for each enemy type I instantiated them within each room by randomly selecting the amount of this type of enemy to spawn between a pre-determined min and max amount. After instantiating one of the enemies, that cell, within the grid becomes “unavailable” so that no more enemies can be spawn in that location. This made for easier integration of enemy and object spawning using the same grid so that no enemies would get spawned and stuck on the same cell as an object like a rock.

### Project Architecture

Not knowing how the creators decided to organize their project (probably pretty well considering their knowledge of game development) I really wanted to ensure I did everything to follow my own established rules within the organization of the project. To begin, I organized my hierarchy to various subsets of possibly Game Objects, specifically, Managers, Setup, Environment, Canvases & Systems

-	Managers,
    -	Scene specific classes, i.e flow of the game
-	Setup
    -	Camera, Lights, post-processing volume, Event System
-	Environment
    -	Spawning terrain, trees, tiles, enemies
-	Canvases
    -	UI elements
-	Systems
    -	Objects in Scene that use “Don’t Destroy on Load”
    -	Audio System
    -	Resource System
        -	Used for references to scriptable objects

Now as for coding architecture, I was not familiar with many prior to starting game development. Through this project and a few others I have begun to learn more sustainable methods to code. I’ve always been under the impression that having a centralized processing unit seems to be very reliable and ideas that I took from Android Development like MVVM seemed to be applicable in game development. Rather than decoupling the business logic from the screen interaction, I used that same idea to decouple the interface logic from the game logic. Although this was not consistent throughout my project, I did make an effort to explore how I would create such implementations for future projects.

Another coding architecture I used was a Hierarchical Finite State Machine, in creating my EnemyController, I have various states that represented particular behaviors and/or conditions, and I had explicit transitions between these states.

Finally, a very popular design pattern is Entity-Component-System (ECS) which is used to manage the behavior and data of game objects efficiently. Despite not being aware of this design pattern, I did to some extent use this within my coding. For example, in creating my player, my entity was a game object representing my player, then using different components, whether through scripts or pre-defined components such as a boxCollider2D or a Sprite Renderer, I isolated the attributes of the player. Finally, my scripts such as my gameManager were responsible for processing these specific components and updating them as needed, for example handling health, bullet shooting or dying. As it is, Unity in its base form tends to use ECS without needing the developer to explicitly follow this coding architecture, but it’s still a useful design pattern that allows for very flexible and scalable game design.

<!-- OBSTACLES AND OBSERVATIONS -->
## Obstacles and Observations

Amongst all the different bugs I encountered and the various issues I faced, I’ve selected a few that I thought were notable mentions, that can either be helpful for my future self or any other aspiring developer. 

### Enemies phasing through Walls

A decent feature to have in your game is to not have enemies from different rooms come and blind-side your player from out of nowhere (cue John Cena theme song). Hence a large problem I faced was enemies from other rooms glitching through my tile maps or the enemies in the current room leaving the area. Now, of course, the biggest issue is the blatant enemy increase or decrease in the room the player is in but also, as my game logic to lock the doors in each room depended on how many enemies were present in the room, once an enemy left, the player was ultimately stuck in the room forever. Hence, to solve this issue, I applied two features:

1.	Make all enemies in other rooms than the current one into an “Idle” state. This also aided in preserving CPU usage as there were less physics movements being calculated throughout the scene
   
2.	Changing the movement of the enemies to use velocity instead of transform.position

### Item Animations

A rather simple but annoying obstacle was seeing simple position transform animations never setting in the position you meant them to set. For example, you instantiate an item object at position x with an animation to bounce it up and down. Next thing you know, as soon as the item begins bouncing in game it changes position to somewhere completely different. This comes from directly manipulating the objects transform in its animator. So, the only solution to this that I was aware of, was to place all animations as child objects of a parent. Then simply adjust the parent transform in order to position the object in a certain location.

### Less than minimum number of Rooms Created

Within the procedural generation of the dungeon, there is a possibility that we could generate a small number of rooms, which would create issues throughout the game loop, such as, not enough space for “special” rooms. Thus, I set up a minimumRooms variable. If the room count by the end of the procedural generation is not above this minimum, I simply recall the entire algorithm until we have reached the minimum number of rooms.

This seemed all well and efficient until I noticed a couple bugs. Firstly, on the regeneration of rooms I noticed sometimes special rooms were not being generated, or doors would be instantiated leading to a non-existing room. I found that when regenerating my dungeon, I was facing a race condition in which I’d recall the algorithm but at the same time call the instantiation of each cell that was supposed to be created. Thus, this caused new rooms to be “created” from the re-run of the dungeon generation but the actual instantiation of the cells would’ve already occurred. To solve this problem, I simply continuously recalled the algorithm from the start until we met the criteria that the number of rooms was greater than my minimum and then we’d call the instantiation of each of these rooms. In my opinion, continuously recalling an algorithm until it gives you what you want isn’t the best approach, however, in this case, there is only a small chance that the dungeon generation generates less than the minimum number of rooms hence, I found recalling the algorithm acceptable.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- NEXT STEPS -->
## Next Steps

As with most projects, your scope can be endless. Especially with making games there is always something to optimize or add, thus in the future, when I find more time, I would like to add the following features to the game.

### The Minimap

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/2c0ce4a3-d69a-47a1-9c2a-0477fc3ea8f7)

This feature shows the first unentered room that the player is aware of. Hence there can be further rooms beyond, however as the player has not searched these rooms yet, they do not know whether there are more rooms or not.

### More Items, Objects and Enemies

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/962a953c-82a2-467e-be13-06d0a494c75e)

This feature is simply a constraint on time. As Animating and recreating similar logic for different enemy, objects and item types was essentially remaking already existing objects it didn’t seem to be the best use of my time to continue adding more. However, given more time, I could definitely add a couple bosses, enemies and power-ups.


### Rooms

![image](https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/b0016a99-c715-402f-a96c-14b1bd1cd6a0)

Another big part of BOI is the various room layouts. In my case I stuck to using one room type as it simplified the process of connecting different rooms together, but in the future, I would like to create rooms of different dimensions and explore how to accurately connect them to give the game more of a “refreshing” feeling rather than always exploring the same room type. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- BUGS -->
## Bugs

In this section, I’d like to briefly explain a couple bugs within the game and possible solutions that may or may not work.

### Player getting stuck between rooms

https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/5347a63f-1a82-4a14-8925-8e081818dc04

https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/e80d1f9e-f58b-45d0-9ef6-203f57731472

As of now I am consistently checking my player’s position in the Update() function and starting events once a player moves between rooms. These events trigger a countdown coroutine to enable boxColliders on the room’s doors’. However, I have found on many instances that if a player is fast enough or slow enough two things can happen:

1.	If the Player is fast enough, they will be able to enable the countdown coroutine and then move back to the previous room before the coroutine ends and thus enabling the boxColliders even when the player is outside the room, causing the game to be un completable.
   
2.	If the player is slow enough, they will trigger the playerPositionChange event and have the boxColliders be enabled while the player is not yet fully in the room, causing them to essentially be stuck within the boxCollider

Now, I attempted lessening the countdown timer to account for bug 1, but it only causes bug 2 to be more prevalent. Thus, I do believe my implementation of room switching is wrong. The more optimal way would be to control the players entrance into a room using an OnTriggerExit2D event. This would allow me to ensure the player is in the room before locking the doors. 

### Tears immediately being destroyed when shooting when player is at the top wall

https://github.com/PaulKokhanov1/BindingofIssacRemake/assets/69466838/5cb07342-4d65-4312-a644-c75bdfe73534

Currently, whenever the player is standing as close as they can to the top wall, all instances of bullets they fire are immediately destroyed because the engine thinks that the bullets are colliding with an object. This prevents the player from essentially shooting or defeating enemies if they are pressed to the top wall. Now my hypothetical solution would be to:

-	Increase the players hitbox such that they are pushed further from the top wall whenever they are close to it and thus instantiating the bullet prefab slightly lower on the players transform.position

There are obviously many… and I mean many more bugs (as you would probably find when playing the game) but ultimately, we know it’s impossible to exhaustively eliminate bugs, hence those are a few I have to address and my thoughts on how to solve them.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
## Conclusion

Overall, being this was my first “long” term project, I am quite satisfied with the result. By no means is it polished and there are lots of things to learn. But as a starting point I have gained a lot of new skills and appreciation for game development. This project has just made me more excited to explore the various possible applications within Unity. Whether that be more games, such as exploring a 3D adventure or an RTS game. I have already started working on a few simple VR applications that have given me more insight into the 3D space. Regardless of where my future projects will take me, I am quite excited to continue learning and applying this newly gained knowledge in all aspects of my development.
